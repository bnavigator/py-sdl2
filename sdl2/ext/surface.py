    Surfaces created with this function will share pixel data with the original
    surface, meaning that any modifications to one surface will result in
    modifications to the other.

    .. note::
       Because subsurfaces share pixel data with their parent surface, they
       *cannot* be used after the parent surface is freed. Doing so will
       almost certainly result in a segfault.

    Args:
        surface (:obj:`~sdl2.SDL_Surface`): The parent surface from which
            new sub-surface should be created.
        area (:obj:`SDL_Rect`, tuple): The ``(x, y, w, h)`` subset of the parent
            surface to use for the new surface, where ``x, y`` are the pixel
            coordinates of the top-left corner of the rectangle and ``w, h`` are
            its width and height (in pixels). Can also be specified as an
            :obj:`SDL_Rect`.
