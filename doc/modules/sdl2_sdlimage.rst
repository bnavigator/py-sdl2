sdl2.sdlimage - Python bindings for SDL2_image
==============================================

py-sdl2 provides bindings for SDL2_image, a library designed for use with SDL2
that adds support for loading a wide range of different common (and uncommon)
image formats for easy use with SDL2. In addition, SDL2_image includes functions
for saving :obj:`SDL_Surface` objects to PNG and/or JPEG images.

.. note::
   If using an alternative rendering system that doesn't use SDL surfaces as
   input (e.g. PyOpenGL), the Pillow imaging library may be a better fit for
   your project.


Initialization and library information functions
------------------------------------------------

.. function:: IMG_Init(flags)

   Initializes the SDL2_image library, enabling support for JPEG, PNG, TIF,
   and/or WebP images as requested. All other image formats can be loaded
   or used regardless of whether this has been called.

   The following are the supported init flags:

   ====== =================
   Format Init flag
   ====== =================
   JPEG   ``IMG_INIT_JPG``
   PNG    ``IMG_INIT_PNG``
   TIFF   ``IMG_INIT_TIF``
   WebP   ``IMG_INIT_WEBP``
   ====== =================

   Can be called multiple times to enable support for these formats
   separately, or can initialize multiple formats at once by passing a set of
   flags as a bitwise OR. You can also call this function with 0 as a flag
   to check which image libraries have already been loaded.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Initialize JPEG and PNG support separately
      for flag in [IMG_INIT_JPG, IMG_INIT_PNG]:
          IMG_Init(flag)
          err = IMG_GetError() # check for any errors loading library
          if len(err):
              print(err)

      # Initialize JPEG and PNG support at the same times
      flags = IMG_INIT_JPG || IMG_INIT_PNG
      IMG_Init(flags)
      if IMG_Init(0) != flags: # verify both libraries loaded properly
          print(IMG_GetError())

   :param flags: A bitwise OR'd set of image formats to load support for.
   :type flags: int

   :retuns: A bitmask of all the currently initialized image loaders.
   :rtype: int


.. function:: IMG_Quit()

   De-initializes the SDL2_image library, disabling JPEG, PNG, TIF, and
   WEBP support and freeing all associated memory.

   Once this has been called, you can re-initialize support for those
   image formats using :func:`IMG_Init` and the corresponding init flags.
   You only need to call this function once, no matter how many times
   :func:`IMG_Init` was called.


.. function:: IMG_GetError()

   Returns the most recently encountered SDL2 error message, if any.

   This function is a simple wrapper around :func:`SDL_GetError`.

   :retuns: A UTF-8 encoded string describing the most recent SDL2 error.
   :rtype: bytes


.. function:: IMG_SetError(fmt)

   Sets the most recent SDL2 error message to a given string.

   This function is a simple wrapper around :func:`SDL_SetError`.

   :param fmt: A UTF-8 encoded string containing the error message to set.
   :type fmt: bytes

   :retuns: Always returns ``-1``.
   :rtype: int


.. function:: IMG_Linked_Version()

   This function gets the version of the dynamically linked SDL2_image
   library.

   :returns: A pointer to an object containing the version of the SDL2_image
     library currently in use.
   :rtype: POINTER(:obj:`SDL_version`)


Image format-checking functions
-------------------------------

These functions are used to check whether an SDL file object
(:obj:`SDL_RWops`) is a valid image file of a given format. Note that
all of these functions will return 0 if SDL2_image was not built with
support for that format, even if it is a valid image of that type, so be
cautious when using these for formats like WEBP, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF, which
are optional when building SDL2_image.

General image loading functions
-------------------------------

.. function:: IMG_Load(file)

   Loads an image file to a new surface. This can load all supported image
   files, including TGA as long as the filename ends with ".tga".

   It is best to call this outside of event loops and keep the loaded
   images around until you are really done with them, as disk speed and
   image conversion to a surface can be slow.

   Once you are done with a loaded image, you can call
   :func:`SDL_FreeSurface` on the returned surface pointer to free up the
   memory associated with it.

   If the image format supports a transparent pixel, SDL_image will set the
   colorkey for the surface. You can enable RLE acceleration on the surface
   afterwards by calling::

      SDL_SetColorKey(image, SDL_RLEACCEL, image.contents.format.colorkey)

   .. note:: If the image loader for the format of the given image requires
             initialization (e.g. PNG) and it is not already initialized,
             this function will attempt to load it automatically.

   :param file: A UTF8-encoded bytestring containing the path to the font
     file to load.
   :type file: bytes

   :returns: A pointer to the new surface containing the image, or a null
     pointer if there was an error.
   :rtype: POINTER(:obj:`SDL_Surface`)


.. function:: IMG_Load_RW(src, freesrc)

   Loads an image file from an SDL2 file object to a new surface. This can
   load all supported formats, *except* TGA. See :func:`IMG_Load` for more
   information.

   :param src: The file object to load an image from.
   :type src: POINTER(:obj:`SDL_RWops`)
   :param freesrc: If non-zero, the input file object will be closed and freed
     after it has been read.
   :type freesrc: int

   :returns: A pointer to the new surface containing the image, or a null
     pointer if there was an error.
   :rtype: POINTER(:obj:`SDL_Surface`)


.. function:: IMG_LoadTyped_RW(src, freesrc, type)

   Loads an image file from an SDL2 file object to a new surface, explicitly
   specifying the format type of the image to load. Here are the different

   =============  ===========================
   b"TGA"         TrueVision Targa

.. function:: IMG_LoadTexture(renderer, file)

   Loads an image file to a new texture using a given renderer. This can
   load all supported image files, including TGA as long as the filename
   ends with ".tga".

   images around until you are really done with them, as disk speed and
   image conversion to a texture can be slow.

   Once you are done with a loaded image, you can call
   :func:`SDL_DestroyTexture` on the returned texture pointer to free up the
   memory associated with it.

   .. note::
      If the image loader for the format of the given image requires
      initialization (e.g. PNG) and it is not already initialized, this
      function will attempt to load it automatically.

   :param renderer: A pointer to the SDL rendering context to create the
     texture with.
   :type renderer: POINTER(:obj:`SDL_Renderer`)
   :param file: A UTF8-encoded bytestring containing the path to the font
